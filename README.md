# Basketball Simulator

This project is a Basketball game simulator built in Python. It allows users to play through simulated basketball games, with detailed play-by-play commentary and statistical tracking.

## Features

- Play through full simulated basketball games.
- Individual player statistics tracking.
- Detailed play-by-play commentary.
- Two teams with five active players and a bench for each team.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/basketball_simulator.git
2. Navigate into the cloned repository:
3. Run the main Python file: python main.py


## How to Play

1. The simulator will begin by allowing you to name both Team 1 and Team 2.
2. You will then enter the main game loop where each possession is simulated.
3. Each possession includes a chance for a steal, block, or foul.
4. If no special events occur during the possession, a shot attempt is made.
5. Points are awarded based on successful shots, and commentary is printed to the console.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed player statistics.
- Implement game saving and loading.
